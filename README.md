This is an e-commerce project which is made in React. I have also used Firebase to maintain the cart items and a mock api to return me the products.

The cart items can be added and removed, can add new products and also sort them in acsending and descending order by price.

React-redux is used along with thunk to perform async operations.

React-router is used to maintain the routing between the home page and cart page.
